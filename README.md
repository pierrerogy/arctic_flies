# Spatial distribution of acalyptrate fly assemblages in northern Canada

## About
This dataset, from my Honours project, results from the 2010-2011 [Northern Biodiversity Program](http://insectecology.mcgill.ca/NBP/index.html), which aimed at documenting diversity patterns of Arctic arthropods. Specimens were collected in twelve locations across Northern Canada, from the Subarctic to the High Arctic zone, as shown in the following map.  Northern Boreal sites are represented by solid circles, Subarctic sites by solid triangles, and High Arctic sites by solid squares. <br />
Site abbreviations are as follows: <br />
- GOO (Goose Bay, NL), MOO (Moosonee, ON), YEL (Yellowknife, NT), and NOR (Norman Wells, NT) for the Northern Boreal ecoclimatic zone; <br />
- SCH (Schefferville, QC), CHU (Churchill, MB), KUG (Kugluktuk, NU), and TOM (Tombstone Mountains, YT) for the Subarctic ecoclimatic zone; <br />
- IQA (Iqaluit, NU), CAM (Cambridge Bay, NU), HAZ (Lake Hazen, NU), and AUL (Aulavik National Park, NU) for the High Arctic ecoclimatic zone.

## Hypotheses
(i) at the local scale, Acalyptratae abundance and richness will be higher in wet habitats compared to mesic ones because wet environments tend to harbour more vegetation, increasing resource availability and potentially niche diversity <br />
(ii) at a continental scale, Acalyptratae diversity and community composition will be strongly associated with seasonal and limiting temperature variables because of their ectothermy  <br />
(iii) because of the poor dispersal ability of many Acalyptratae taxa, as well as current and former geographic barriers (e.g. Pleistocene glaciations), there will be overall high species turnover between sites and across ecoclimatic zones

## Metadata

### Scripts
The analyses consists of three separate scripts, with self-explanatory names (scripts #01-#03), and one metadata script (#04). <br />

### EML
Metadata is available in [EML format](https://github.com/pierrerogy/arctic_flies/blob/master/ArcticFlies.xml), as coded in script #04 <br />

### Table format
Family | Genus | Species | Abundance | Locality | Province.Territory | Ecoclimatic_zone | Side | Latitude | Longitude | Moisture_Regime | Replicate | Date | Trapping_Method |
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
Linnaean family | Linnaean genus | Binomial name (may include name of authority) | Number of specimens collected | Locality of collection | Corresponding Province or Territory | Corresponding ecoclimatic zone (Northern boreal (NB), Subarctic (SA) or High Artic (HA) | Western or eastern Canada | GPS latitude of replicate | GPS longitude of replicate | Moisture regime of the replicate (Mesic or Wet) | Number of the replicate | Date of collection (days.month.yer) | Malaise trap, pan traps, or sweep netting |
