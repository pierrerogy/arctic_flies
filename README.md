One of the biggest mysteries of Arctic arthropod ecology is the overwhelming dominance of Diptera. Solving this riddle  requires a comprehensive framework of diversity patterns, and is especially important as this taxon can be used to assess shifts in rapidly-changing Arctic ecosystems. Using data from the [Northern Biodiversity Program](https://northernbiodiversity.wordpress.com/), we aimed at analysing spatial diversity patterns for a poorly known group of flies, [Acalyptratae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acalyptratae).
